Pet project about movies

Here I try various libraries and architectural approaches that I find convenient and interesting.

I am also trying to show the correct, in my opinion, approach to organizing work with tasks in a project.

I work on the project in my free time, so there may be long breaks between commits.

Any help is welcome! I hope you find something useful/interesting for yourself.
